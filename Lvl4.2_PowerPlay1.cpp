*     INSTRUCTIONS:
*       Copy & paste prev. PowerPlay for deck of cards & move all classes to separate .h and .cpp files
*       Deck Class modification: Constructor that calls 'shuffleEntireDeck()'
*       Hand Class modification: nothing
*       Player Class modification: Conversion constructor that takes an int ante & a int& pot,
*         subtracts ante from the money and adds it to the pot. Also asks the player how much money they have.
*       Enum class "Action{ call, fold, bid };", private member Action currentAction{ Action::bid };, 
*       Call method, now sets currentAction;, fold method, sets currentAction;
*       raise(int& pot) asks for bid, removes from money, adds to pot, sets action.
*       Use 'void takeTurn(int& pot);', 'bool isBidding() const;', and 'void newRound();' */
