 *    INSTRUCTIONS:
 *      Create three variables: 'float sallysAllowance{ 0.0f };', 'float johnsAllowance{ 0.0f };', and 
 *        'float* dad{ nullptr };'
 *      Start a while loop until dad is done, ask dad who he is going to pay allowance to,
 *      Have dad point at the person he is giving allowance to, ask dad how much, and 
 *      Add that amount to the person's allowance, using the dad pointer    */
